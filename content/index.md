Hi and welcome to my little corner on the internet.
Introverted, self-taught programmer with different hobbies and ideas.
I do have an [[About me]] section if you want to know more, alternatively here are some [[Hobbies]] ðŸ¤—

Over time I will be trying to do some write-ups of different ideas I have / projects Iâ€™ve worked on.

For now I'd like to share my [[Obsidian to Quartz setup]] and my little [[Amazon Kindle Download Helper]].

If you'd like to ask me a question of leave a comment, please [create an issue](https://github.com/husjon/husjon/issues/new) or message me on <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@husjon">Mastodon</a> and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

And if got all the way here, Thank you ðŸ’—
