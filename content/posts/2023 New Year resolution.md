I'm not much of a New Year Resolution type of person, but this year I will try to focus on the following:


# Reading
My [goodreads goal](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/36175518) for 2022 was 8 books, which will be accomplished by reading 17 (+9 ahead of the goal).  
Currently finishing up The Luminous Dead by Caitlin Starling.

My average book size were around 250 pages.

For 2023, I'll aim for 12.  
I find it better to aim for a lower goal and crushing it, rather than aiming to high and not succeeding.

List of [[../Books]] I've read so far.


# Drawing
I'm gonna try to draw more.  
Main focus will be pixel art.  
Maybe convert older pieces to pixel art.
