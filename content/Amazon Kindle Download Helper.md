After having acquired a few books for my Kindle from Amazon, I've found that backing these up is extremely tedious.  
In case you've not experienced it, here are the steps:
1. Go to [Manage Your Content and Devices][kindle_manage_content]
2. Click **More actions**
3. Click **Download & transfer via USB**
4. Select the device to download for (for [DRM][wiki_drm] reasons)
5. Click **Download**
6. Repeat step 2 - 5 for each book

This as you might understand, gets really annoying really quickly, especially when buying a couple of books on sale.

So after some thinking I thought I might try to give a shot at using JavaScript and [TamperMonkey][TamperMonkey] which injects userscripts on any page you want to simplify this process.  
Tampermonkey allows you to do quite a few cool things like changing colors, adding/removing features and a whole lot more.

It's been a while since I've done any work with Javascript and jQuery, so revisiting it was quite refreshing.

After spending some time finding which elements I needed for selectors etc, I came up with a simple solution which re-uses the existing checkboxes and adds a button to download the selected books.

With this helper, we can now use the existing checkboxes or **Select All**, then the newly added **Download Selected** button.  
The script then iterates over each book on the current page, then starts the download process for each.

Here's a video showing it in action:

If this is something that you'd like to use yourself, you can find it in my [Tampermonkey repository][tampermonkey_repository]
